# KeywordFramework

Keyword Driven Framework is a type of Functional Automation Testing Framework which is also known as Table-Driven testing or Action Word based testing. The basic working of the Keyword Driven Framework is to divide the Test Case in to four different parts. First is called as Test Step, second is Object of Test Step, third is Action on Test Object and fourth is Data for Test Object. 

The above categorization can be done and maintained with the help of Excel spread sheet:

Test Step: It is a very small description of the Test Step or the description of the Action going to perform on Test Object.
Test Object: It is the name of the Web Page object/element, like Username & Password.
Action: It is the name of the action, which is going to perform on any Object such as click, open browser, input etc.
Test Data: Data can be any value which is needed by the Object to perform any action, like Username value for Username field.

This is a sample way to do it modify based on your intent.
